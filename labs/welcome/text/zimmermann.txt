We intend to begin  on the first of February  unrestricted submarine warfare. We
shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral. In
the event of this not succeeding,  we make Mexico a  proposal of alliance on the
following  basis:  make war together,  make peace together,  generous  financial
support  and an understanding  on our part  that Mexico is to reconquer the lost
territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The settlement in detail is left to
you.  You will inform  the President  of the above most secretly  as soon as the
outbreak  of war  with the  United States  of America  is certain,  and  add the
suggestion that  he should,  on his own initiative,  invite  Japan to  immediate
adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves.  Please call
the  President's  attention  to the fact that  the  ruthless  employment  of our
submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to make
peace.
